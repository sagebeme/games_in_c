## Getting Started

Before diving into the projects, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one yet, consider using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), which is widely supported and works on various platforms.

To compile and run a game, navigate to the game's directory and use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -o game_name game_name.c
./game_name
